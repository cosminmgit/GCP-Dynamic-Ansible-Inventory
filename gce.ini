# The GCE inventory script has the following dependencies:
#   1. A valid Google Cloud Platform account with Google Compute Engine
#      enabled.  See https://cloud.google.com
#   2. An OAuth2 Service Account flow should be enabled.  This will generate
#      a private key file that the inventory script will use for API request
#      authorization.  See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2
#   3. Convert the private key from PKCS12 to PEM format
#      $ openssl pkcs12 -in pkey.pkcs12 -passin pass:notasecret \
#      > -nodes -nocerts | openssl rsa -out pkey.pem
#   4. The libcloud (>=0.13.3) python libray.  See http://libcloud.apache.org
#
# (See ansible/test/gce_tests.py comments for full install instructions)
